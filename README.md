IDEA: Stock Prediction Simulation

Required:
Motivate and define the problem:    20
Briefly mention related work:    20
Explain at least one the main ideas of your project clearly:    20
Explain the uncertainties that are involved in getting a proof of concept running: 20
Explain how to mitigate uncertainties in getting various components of your proof of concept running: 20

Motivate and define the problem:
  Determining the best time to buy or sell a certain quantity of shares for a company of choice.
  
Briefly mention related work:
  

Explain at least one the main ideas of your project clearly:
  -Simulate multiple stock prediction methods side by side. Create tests to compare the output data of all ranking from best to worst.
  -

Explain the uncertainties that are involved in getting a proof of concept running:
  -Uncertainties include a low understanding of the different prediction methods included in the repository we are analysing (more research)
  -How effective is the data collected in terms of transferring events documented in this data to current and future events?
    -If there are real-world events occuring in which the markets are altrered, how can we effectively utilize our models in these situations?
  
  -An uncertainity regarding the main idea above: Determining the best model available will prove to be quite challenging.
    -If everyone taking part in stock exchange utilizes these models, how will it affect the the market itself? Would these models still be useful if that were the case?

Explain how to mitigate uncertainties in getting various components of your proof of concept running:
  -More searches regarding how each of the prediction agents and deep learning methods presented in the repo function (in terms of benefiting someone in the stock market)
