Motivate and define the problem:
  Determining the best time to buy or sell a certain quantity of shares for a company of choice.
  
Briefly mention related work:
  

Explain at least one the main ideas of your project clearly:
  -Simulate multiple stock prediction methods side by side. Create tests to compare the output data of all ranking from best to worst.
  -

Explain the uncertainties that are involved in getting a proof of concept running:
  -Uncertainties include a low understanding of the different prediction methods included in the repository we are analysing (more research)
  -

Explain how to mitigate uncertainties in getting various components of your proof of concept running:
